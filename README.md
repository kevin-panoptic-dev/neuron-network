# Neuron Network Implemented in Pure Python

_The thing that makes neural networks appear challenging, is the math that is involved, and how scary it can sometimes look._

This repository is based on the awesome book [Neural Networks from Scratch](https://nnfs.io/), and the objective is th break down the overall complexity into smaller, more digestible pieces.

## Table of Contents

1. Single Neuron
1. Dense Layer
1. Activation Functions
1. Loss Functions
1. Backpropagation
1. Optimization

## Requirements

#### Math Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra is recommended. In general, just be comfortable working with chain rule and matrices.

It probably takes less than 2 weeks if you study these topics on Khan Academy. The mathematics is very basic since neuron networks are required to process large amount of data.

#### Python Prerequisites

A basic understanding of object-oriented programming is required. However, specific knowledge of the array library we use is not required.

We are going to use [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for basic matrix operations, especially within the format of jupyter notebook. Formal python scripts will be written in [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is faster and modern alternative to NumPy.

We will also use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for visualization.

## Formatting

For each topic we will have a separate folder, with each folder containing jupyter notebooks and python scripts.

Jupyter notebooks are good for writing mathematical formulas, while python scripts is easier for importing and organizing the code.
